# ANLP_TaCL_BERT_Analysis

This repository contains the code and materials for Unit Test Case Analysis on BERT and TACL models:
To understand how well BERT and TACL models perform Unit Test case Analysis was Performed:
1.	By Calculating Intra Sentence Similarity
2.	To Calculate the Correlation matrix of tokens and Visualize the Self-similarity of Tokens in the sentence.

The main focus of this analysis is on the `Unit_test_case_Analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, which includes various tests and visualizations to understand and evaluate BERT's capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Jupyter Notebook, you will need:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Transformers
- TensorFlow or PyTorch

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/sandeep-varma8029/ANLP_TaCL_BERT_Analysis.git

```

2. Change into the project directory:

```
cd ANLP_TaCL_BERT_Analysis
```

3. Install the required packages using `pip`:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Jupyter Notebook

You can run the Jupyter Notebook `Unit_test_case_Analysis.ipynb` locally or using Google Colab.

#### Local setup

1. Start the Jupyter Notebook server:

```
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open `Unit_test_case_Analysis.ipynb` in your browser and start running the cells.

#### Google Colab

1. Open the Notebook using the following link: [Unit_test_case_Analysis.ipynb on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MlVKkdwgd-hRf3Om-a71pOzApLdMH26Y?usp=sharing)

2. Click on `File` > `Save a copy in Drive` to create a copy of the Notebook in your Google Drive.

3. Start running the cells in your copied Notebook.

### Dataset

You will need the 10k dataset to run the analyses in the Jupyter Notebook. Please download the dataset and place it in the project directory before running the Notebook.
